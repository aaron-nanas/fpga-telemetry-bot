WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga_blue_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_blue_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell vga_blue_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga_green_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_green_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell vga_green_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga_red_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_red_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell vga_red_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
