2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_1_5, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_5_3, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_7_3, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_7_5, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_7_6, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#6 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance inferred_bram_for_image_instance/single_port_bram_reg_7_7, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>
